Entry.create(section_id: econ.id, title: 'Dispelling the Myth of Casinos', author: 'Ashley Madrid', url: 'http://www.amazon.com/What-Can-Tribes-Institutions-Development/dp/0935626379', content: '<p>According to the book, <em>What Can Tribes Do?</em> there have been many myths reproduced by the non-Indian community that make casinos a burden on society. In reality, casinos have been an effort of the American Indian community to better their reservations and provide a chance for a better future. Not all tribes have casinos, out of the 560 nations, only 224 are involved in gaming; some may only host bingo games. Casinos have benefited the reservations because the unemployment rate of American Indians is around 15%. Reservations that have casinos benefit because they receive a percentage from the profit made from the casino. Although many people view the American Indian casino business as a threat to privately owned casino businesses, the American Indian casino business only makes up 8% of the total revenue of casinos in the United States. Casinos became a right for tribes in the 1970&rsquo;s, when self-determination came about and offered the tribes ways to move &ldquo;forward&rdquo; instead of backwards. Being self-reliant became the way for casinos to prosper and become approved since they would offer a tribe economic self-reliance.</p> <p>Despite myths, casinos are a major need on reservations because the few successful ones don&rsquo;t allow all tribal members to benefit even if their reservations are part of &ldquo;revenue sharing programs&rdquo;. Tribes are still in poverty because of many reasons; a few are: &ldquo;Tribes and individuals lack access to financial capital, Tribes and individuals lack human capital (education, skills, technical expertise) and the means to develop it. Reservations lack effective planning, Reservations are subject to too much planning and not enough action, Reservations are poor in natural resources, and Reservations have natural resources, but lack sufficient control over them&rdquo; (6). Another problem is the willingness for outside investors to invest themselves and their money into reservations to stabilize their economic situation.&nbsp; In <em>What Can Tribes Do?</em> we see that even when jobs are created, like opening a casino and providing employment for American Indians,</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Financial assets are also necessary for economic development. Investment dollars have to come from somewhere in order to provide people with the tools and materials needed to make them productive and competitive. The $10,000 needed to stock an auto parts store, the $8,000 needed to buy used agricultural equipment, the $2,000 to expand an arts and crafts cooperative, or the millions needed for a tribal sawmill all depend on individuals or private or public entities willingness to invest" (20).</p> <p>It is because of this that there is still poverty within reservations, especially those that do not have casinos.</p>')

Entry.create(section_id: econ.id, title: 'How a Casino Can Affect the City Around It', author: 'Ashley Madrid',  url: 'http://www.kpbs.org/news/2012/mar/07/tribes-use-casino-profits-buy-real-estate/', content: '<p>A casino affects the reservation and also the city around it. In San Diego County, there are 10 Vegas-style casinos that involve the people of San Diego County and bring in thousands of visitors a year. The visitor influx helps the San Diego community economically because downtown is a major tourist attraction. However, the tourist population visiting the casino, adds unnecessary traffic to the San Diego area. In the last ten years, the Sycuan reservation has bought 1,300 acres around their reservation, nearly tripling its size (Florido, &ldquo;Indian Tribes Use Casino Profits&hellip;). The purchase of the land was possible because of the profits made from the Sycuan Casino. Last year, the reservation asked the Bureau of Indian Affairs to designate the newly purchased land as reservation land. Through this designation, the land would be &ldquo;no longer subject to local taxes, laws, or building restrictions&rdquo; (Florido). In addition to the Sycuan reservation, San Diego County has an additional 60 pending applications from tribes to the Bureau of Indian Affairs totaling up to 13,000 acres (Florido).</p><p>As much as this would benefit the expansion of the reservation and the casino, it would cause great losses for the city of San Diego. Groups are against this expansion because it would result in a loss of 1.3 million in property taxes. However, the Sycuan tribe realizes how great of a loss the taxes would be to the city and agreed to build homes, RV parks, and a new road to make up the loss. These are great ways for the city and for the reservations to build closer ties and benefit each other.</p> ')

Entry.create(section_id: news.id, title: 'Indian Gaming and Its Effects in Southern California', author: 'Group 5', content: '<p>The history of Indian gaming is a complicated one. For years, Indian gaming has been a hot-button issue in California with many proponents both for and against it. While there have been, and continue to be, many in depth arguments both for and against, there seems to be a roughly two sided debated raging.</p><p>On one hand, a perceived image of tribes with casinos is that they have become exceedingly wealthy and no longer need to be "taken care of" by the U.S. government. Others that can be put in this group believe that gambling itself is destructive to the community. On the other side, are those who believe that Indian gaming can be used as a way to elevate tribes out of poverty in addition to helping tribes determine their own fate. There are many examples of tribes becoming quite successful and wealthy because of the casinos that they opened; the tribes most notably in southern California are the Sycuan, Barona, and Viejas bands. In these cases, casinos have helped pull tribes out of poverty, and bring them into the modern world.</p><p>The reality, in many cases however, is that casinos are not a cure for the individual problems every tribe faces, not the least of which is public opposition to the creation of a casino. In many cases tribes barely break even or have to close down reservation casinos altogether because of their lack of revenue and foot-traffic do to the rural areas the reservations are located on.</p><p>Tribes face many challenges as they work towards full self-determination, and many see casinos and gambling as a way to help achieve that. Why are tribal run gaming casinos the focus of so much controversy; why is there so much opposition? It is time to take a look at the real economic, cultural, and religious effects of Indian casinos, both successful and otherwise, on the reservation communities associated with them.</p>')

Entry.create(section_id: hist.id, title: 'Indian Gaming Legislation', author: 'Michael May', url: 'http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/glr.2005.9.439', content: '<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Indian Gaming Legislation</strong></span><br />The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) is possibly the most important piece of legislation related to Indian gaming. The act split up gaming into 3 classes with each class getting respectively harder to achieve.</p> <p>Class one encompasses traditional Indian gaming and small wager gambling, this is not restricted by the government. Class two includes bingo and other bingo-like games this also cannot be restricted by state government. Class three is the most controversial because it includes casino type and large wager gambling. Whether a tribe can enter into this form of gambling is dependent on individual tribal negotiations with the state.</p> <p>IGRA was passed in direct response to the California vs. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians Supreme Court ruling because of the confusion surrounding the legality of Indian gaming. According to IGRA, a casino can only be &ldquo;located on tribal lands acquired in trust by the Secretary of Interior &hellip; before 1988&rdquo; (Staudenmaier 439). Despite this restriction, there are some big exception that can be made for tribes that want to build on land that was taken into trust later, and this is where the controversy lies. There are six ways in which a tribe can get around this land restriction:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) The lands are adjacent to lands that were in trust in 1988 <br /> 2) Lands are already located within the reservation where the tribe is now <br /> 3) Lands are taken into trust as part of a settlement of land claim <br /> 4) The tribe has newly been recognized by the Secretary of Interior <br /> 5) Lands are taken into trust as part of the restoration of lands for the tribe and the tribe has been restored to federal recognition <br /> 6) The Secretary of Interior takes the land into trust for the tribe <br /> (Staudenmaier 439-430). </p> <p><br /><strong>Works Cited</strong><br />Staudenmaier, Heidi McNeil, and Anne Bishop.
